This repository contains code for a reference database and manager.

When writing a document that requires referencing academic or technical work,
one often ends up using incomplete or incorrect references from Google Scholar
or other similar sources. This project aims to create an open reference
database structure that can be deployed locally or remotely and synchronised
with other sources.

This project is a work in progress; do not expect anything to work at this
stage.

Run `make database` to set up the backend database.
